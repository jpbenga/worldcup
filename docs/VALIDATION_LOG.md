Commit: `e3913e7 Add manual validation checklists`

### Technical validation

- [x] Backend pipeline passed
- [x] JSON snapshots generated
- [x] Backend snapshots match Angular assets
- [x] Angular build passed
- [x] Angular tests passed
- [x] Forbidden artifacts check passed
- [x] Data provenance files present
- [x] Mock data clearly identified as non-real data

### Manual visual validation

- [ ] Home page checked
- [ ] Data status section checked
- [ ] Provenance badges checked
- [ ] Match cards checked
- [ ] Prediction probabilities checked
- [ ] Score matrix checked
- [ ] Market summary checked
- [ ] Prediction history checked
- [ ] Responsible notice checked
- [ ] Browser console checked
- [ ] Network JSON HTTP 200 checked

### Result

- [ ] Validated
- [ ] Validated with reservations
- [ ] Not validated

### Notes

Technical checks completed on 2026-06-10. The backend pipeline generated all
expected snapshots, JSON validation passed, backend snapshots matched Angular
assets, and the Angular build and tests passed with Node `22.22.3`.

The broad forbidden-artifacts command returned
`backend/scripts/build_snapshots.py` because its filename contains `build`.
A path-aware check confirmed that no forbidden build directory or artifact is
tracked.

Manual visual validation still requires human review before moving to V0.3.

### Issues to fix before next phase

- Complete the manual visual validation checklist and record the human decision.
